    Cluster in the cloud gives you ideas and reference architecture to expand your cluster to the cloud.
    It is backed by <a href="http://eresearchsa.github.io/dynamiccluster">Dynamic Cluster</a>.
  </section>

## Overview

Dynamic Cluster is a key element in the deployment of cluster in the cloud. However, we also need other tools to make the cluster work to our standard.

Some aspects to consider:

- Selection of cloud system
- Authentication Mechanisms of the cloud
- Configuring Workload Managers/Schedulers
- Performance / workload of jobs running in the cloud
- Decision on which jobs to Cloud Burst.
- Network connectivity
- Cloud Security



## Reference architecture

We give several reference architecture here to give readers a better idea on how to use Dynamic Cluster.

Again everyone can use it in a different way. The following setups are just examples.

* All in one: suitable for new users who want to quickly get Dynamic Cluster running in the cloud.
* Torque HA: this is the model used by eResearch SA to provide cluster in the cloud solution to users.
